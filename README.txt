This is a simple Dice Roller I coded in my free time using NetBeans IDE 8.2.

It currently features any positive number of dice type (ex: d20) and any positive number of dice amount (ex: 6d20).

The roll types it features are:
  •A default roll
  •An exploding roll - Roll same die type again when roll is critical. 
  •An advantage roll - Roll 2 dice, return the higher value.
  •A disadvantage roll - Roll 2 dice, return the lower value.
  
The GUI is unpolished, default, NetBeans 8.2 JFrame.

I do not currently have any plans to continue this project, beyond a possible summing method.
Feel free to request features, but do not be disappointed if I do not respond or choose to implement them.
