This is a simple Dice Roller I coded in my free time using NetBeans IDE 8.2.

It currently features any positive number of dice type (ex: d20) and any positive number of dice amount (ex: 6d20).

The roll types it features are: a default roll, an exploding roll (Roll again when roll is critical 
{ex: 1d20 Result 20, 1d20 result 5, result [20, 5]}), an advantage roll (roll 2 dice, return the higher value), and a disadvantage roll
(same as advantage but returns the lower value).

The GUI is unpolished, default, netbeans jframe.
